This is an Simple Python Keylogger it is used to capture the Keyboard Keys User or target pressed.
we can also update it by just converting normal logs String into JSON STRING  we can than post this logs into our server.
With these our keylogger can be remote and it will give us logs of our target if its in wan or lan.

We can also convert .PY file into .EXE file with that it can bypass the VIRUS AND THREAT PROTECTION.
also I m working on one thing after some work i m gonna make this keylogger like after running exe file it will create a 
copy of itself in deep of Targets's computer and delete its file from where Target started so Target cant delete the File even if he wants to.

also put the task in task manager way lower.
